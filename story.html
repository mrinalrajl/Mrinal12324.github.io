        The story of how I discovered my passion for design and user experience

            <h3>The Spark</h3>
            <p>It all started with a simple question: "Why is this app so hard to use?" I was frustrated with poorly designed interfaces and realized that good design isn't just about aesthetics—it's about solving real problems for real people.</p>

          <div class="story-card card">
            <div class="story-year">2020</div>
            <h3>First Steps</h3>
            <p>I dove into design thinking and user research. Learning about empathy mapping, user personas, and wireframing opened my eyes to a whole new world. I started redesigning apps I used daily, just for practice.</p>

            <div class="story-year">2021</div>
            <h3>The Breakthrough</h3>
            <p>My first real project—designing a mobile app for a local business. Watching users interact with something I created was magical. Their feedback taught me more than any tutorial ever could. I was hooked.</p>

            <h3>Expanding Horizons</h3>
            <p>I discovered the intersection of design and development. Learning iOS development and SwiftUI allowed me to bring my designs to life. Understanding code made me a better designer—I could design with implementation in mind.</p>

            <h3>Professional Growth</h3>
            <p>Working on real-world projects taught me the importance of accessibility, performance, and scalability. I learned to balance user needs with business goals, and how to advocate for users in every decision.</p>

            <h3>Design Systems & Innovation</h3>
            <p>I fell in love with design systems—creating consistent, scalable experiences across platforms. Exploring AI-driven design tools and staying ahead of trends like glassmorphism and micro-interactions became my passion.</p>
