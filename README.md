# Mrinal Raj Lakkimsetty — Portfolio

A modern, highly visual, and interactive portfolio website inspired by Apple’s macOS design language. This site showcases my experience, projects, and skills as an iOS Developer & UI/UX Designer, with a focus on minimalism, glassmorphism, and smooth, professional animations.

## ✨ Design Highlights
- **Apple/macOS-inspired UI:** Floating glassmorphic navigation bar, immersive hero, and section cards with soft glows and gradients.
- **Glassmorphism:** All main sections use layered transparency, blur, and subtle borders for a premium, modern look in both light and dark modes.
- **Professional Typography:** Clear font hierarchy using Montserrat and Inter for maximum readability and recruiter appeal.
- **Dynamic Section Dividers:** Animated, icon-based dividers visually separate each section.
- **Dark Mode:** Toggle for a beautiful, accessible dark theme with glass effects and high contrast.
- **Responsive & Accessible:** Fully responsive layout, keyboard navigation, and accessible color contrast.
- **Smooth Animations:** Apple-style transitions, floating nav, and scroll-in effects for a delightful user experience.

## 🚀 Features

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
