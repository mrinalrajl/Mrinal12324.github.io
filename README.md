# Mrinal Raj Lakkimsetty — Portfolio

A modern, Apple-inspired personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, experience, and projects with a focus on minimalism, glassmorphism, and smooth, professional UI/UX.

## ✨ Features
- **macOS/Apple-inspired UI:** Floating glassy navigation bar, immersive hero, and section cards with glassmorphism and colorful glows.
- **Professional Recruiter Experience:** Clear, readable font hierarchy and card-based layout for experience and projects, making it easy for recruiters to scan and evaluate.
- **Dark & Light Mode:** Seamless toggle with beautiful glass effects and adaptive color palette for both modes.

## 🖌️ Design Philosophy
- **Minimalism:** Clean layouts, generous spacing, and focus on content.
- **Glassmorphism:** All main sections and cards use blurred, semi-transparent backgrounds with soft borders and glows, inspired by macOS Big Sur/Monterey.
- **Colorful Accents:** Section dividers and nav bar feature subtle gradients and glows for a modern, premium feel.
- **Professional Typography:** Uses Montserrat for headings and Inter for body text, with a clear hierarchy and optimal line spacing.
- **Recruiter-Friendly:** Experience and project sections are card-based, with bold headings, clear dates, and concise bullet points for easy review.
